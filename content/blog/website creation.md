### Hugo Static Site Generator

The framework this website is built on is [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo").  Hugo allows you to build a website to deliver static content in through the use repeatable templates in a simple, yet powerful, architecture.  I am a network engineer by day that dabbles in code, and am far from being a developer, and Hugo allows me to deliver content quickly that is styled and polished.

### Open Source Themes: Resume from Start Bootstrap & Eddie Webbinaro

Hugo empowers you to build elegant and attractive websites from community-built themes or themes of your own.  This site leverages a theme built by [Eddie Webbinaro](https://webbinaro.dev/), which is derived from an free and open source Bootstrap CSS theme from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume).

### Netlify Content Delivery

Netlify integrates with source countrol platforms like Github to deploy your websites from your code repositories.  While there are pricing tiers based on the utilization, updates, and scale of your websites, for many dabblers like myself, there is a free-tier that provides all the functionality required!

### Where should you start?

To get started with Hugo, I followed the book [Build Websites with Hugo](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhhugo/build-websites-with-hugo/#:~:text=Hugo%20is%20a%20static%20site,the%20skills%20you%20already%20have)  This book is very easy to follow, uses practical examples, and is a ton of fun.
