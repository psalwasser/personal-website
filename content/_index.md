I am a highly skilled and experienced network engineer. I have unique experience in industrial control system networking and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). I understand the needs of Operations Technology (OT) professionals and speak their language. I am at my best when I am in front of a whiteboard demystifying network concepts to non-technical and technical folks alike!
