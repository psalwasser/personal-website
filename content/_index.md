I am a highly skilled and experienced IT/OT architect, engineer, and leader. I have unique experience in industrial control system networks, servers, and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). I understand the needs of OT professionals and speak their language.  I am at my best when putting this unique experience into action and leading change to make OT infrastructure a competitive advantage for organizations!
